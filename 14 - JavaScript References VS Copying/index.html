      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let year = 1928;
      // let year2 = year;
      // console.log(year, year2);
      // year = 2000;
      // console.log(year, year2);

      // let text = "Hello";
      // let text2 = text;
      // console.log(text, text2);
      // text = "Hi";
      // console.log(text,text2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const copyPlayers = players;

      console.log(players, copyPlayers);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // copyPlayers.push("Jack");

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const newArray = [].concat(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const newArr = [...players];

      const team2 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team2[2] = "Yesss";
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const man = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(man);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const man2 = {...person};

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },

      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);

      const spec = Object.assign({}, wes);
